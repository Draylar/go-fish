     * In recent Minecraft versions, fishing was changed so that rare loot could only be obtained in large bodies of water (to combat fish farms).
     * The downside to this is that Go Fish's /fish command can not give crates or rare loot, because this conditional returns false.
     * We assume this check only matters when the player is fishing in survival, and always pass the check when the player is creative.
     * In other words, we fall back to old treasure fishing behavior when the player is in creative mode.
